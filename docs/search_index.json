Powering this tremendous growth is the working people of NYC, who came from different backgrounds and contributed to the booming industries of the city. However, working opportunities are not always abundant. The fierce competition between disadvantaged groups such as the Irish immigrants and the Black population escalates to one of the worst riots in American history. In the meantime, the working conditions of women under-regulated industry “the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the city’s worst industrial disaster, took the lives of 146 garment workers and spurred the growth of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union and major improvements in factory safety standards.”2 “New York Urbanized Area: Population &amp; Density from 1800 (Provisional)”.

It collects censuses and surveys around the world and throughout time, documents them thoroughly, and hosts the datasets in standardized formats for research and public access. In this project, we use IPUMS USA3, which is part of the database that covers United States population using decennial census records. The whole database for IPUMS USA contains 191,983,898 historical person records for the year 1850 to 1940, and 180,755,919 unique person records for censuses after 1940. Though our analysis is focused on the NYC population during its important transition period at the turn of 20th century, the methodology and code we developed and open-sourced can be easily generalized to the analysis of modern day census data as well as for other geographical areas. 2.2 Data Generation Process Figure 2.1: Data Generation Process The data were originally collected by census takers, who were recruited and trained by the Census Bureau to go door to door and collect the demographic information. The raw entry are logged on sheets of paper and stored in archives across the country. With recent development and wide-spread of digitization technology, many of the census records are scanned and digitized. Furthermore, volunteers and commercial teams have been transcribing the records based on the digital scans to convert the record into a fully machine-readable format. National archive and organization like Ancestry Library have taken on such transcription effort. Finally, the IPUMS project, along with many partners in the area, clean the transcribed data, harmonize the variables across different years, and encode the data in a standard coding system for efficient storage and retrieval. We are able to analyze the data we have today thanks to the awe-inspiring work of all the parties involved in this long journey of data generation process. 2.3 Data Extraction Workflow Figure 2.2: Data Extraction Workflow The whole IPUMS USA database is huge, so we need to create an extract based on the scope of our project. The first step is to select samples, which specifies from which year and what percentage of datasets to extract. Second step is to select variables, which are indexed by topical and alphabetical order. Finally, we add a filter based on city variable to limit the scope to NYC, since the data for the whole country is more than 70 GB and not relevant to our project. 2.4 Choice of Variables We choose the variables based on 3 criteria: relevancy, availability, usability. We first identify 57 variables that describe demographic data and / or contain information about working condition and job opportunity (relevancy). Then, we keep 33 variables that are recorded in multiple census years in our scope (availability). Finally, we shortlist 25 variables that are well-documented and have low missing value rate (usability). Among these variables, 7 are numerical variables, 16 are categorical (nominal) variables, the other two are temporal (year) and spatial (city), respectively. There are 333,959 records in the dataset we analyze, which is an one-percent random sample of the full-count data. The full-count data is larger than the RAM of our computer thus we conduct sampling, but the code and analysis is applicable to the full-count given more computing power. 2.5 Issues with the Data The IPUMS USA database is systematically cleaned and edited, thus most data quality issues are dealt with and marked with data quality flags. For our specific use case, we have encountered two data issues. First, some categorical fields have very infrequent entries that are not relevant to our analysis. In other words, the categorization are too detailed and add little to our faceted visualizations. Second, variables like occupations and industries have a high cardinality and the frequencies of each value are about evenly distributed. For these variables, we need to cluster values into meaningful groups to make comprehensible graphs. These two data issues are addressed in the next chapter - data cleaning.

Here, we use the function read_ipums_ddi to read in the data codebook, which is downloaded along with the extract and stored in XML format. In an R development environment such as RStudio, you can use the command ipums_view(ddi) to open an interactive codebook through the built-in viewer. Then, we can use read_ipums_micro(ddi) to load the actual dataset into the environment, given data file is placed next the XML codebook. library(ipumsr) library(tidyverse) library(sf) # Read in codebook ddi &lt;- read_ipums_ddi(&quot;./data/usa_00038.xml&quot;) # Load in data data &lt;- read_ipums_micro(ddi) ## Use of data from IPUMS USA is subject to conditions including that users should ## cite the data appropriately. Use command `ipums_conditions()` for more details. 3.2 Reduce Cardinality and Decode Data As discussed in the previous chapter, one issue with the data is that some variables have a high cardinality with roughly even proportion. For these categories, we cannot lump the minority values into the Other category. For this project, we collect the multi-layer categorization from the IPUMS documentation to cluster the occupation and industry into larger categories 5. We also make a decision to use lbl_na_if function from IPUMSR to mark non-occupational responses such as “keeping house” as missing values. # Remove varialbes with lower usability, as explained in previous chapter data &lt;- data %&gt;% select(-c(SERIAL, PERNUM, RELATED, RACED, BPLD, MBPLD, FBPLD, YRSUSA2, MTONGUE, MTONGUED, PRESGL)) # Data augmentation for categories of occupations and industries occ_cat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./data/occupation_categories.csv&quot;) ind_cat &lt;- read_csv(&quot;./data/industry_categories.csv&quot;) data &lt;- left_join(data, occ_cat, by =&#39;OCC1950&#39;) data &lt;- left_join(data, ind_cat, by =&#39;IND1950&#39;) # NA relabeling based on code range data$OCC1950 &lt;- lbl_na_if(data$OCC1950, ~.val &gt; 970) %&gt;% as_factor() data$IND1950 &lt;- lbl_na_if(data$IND1950, ~.val &gt;= 975 | .val == 0) %&gt;% as_factor() data$OCCSCORE &lt;- as.numeric(data$OCCSCORE) # Factorize columns df &lt;- as_factor(data) 3.3 Handling N/A, Special Cases and Enforce Data Types The other data issue (tail values) is addressed through a series of column-specific data transformations. More specifically, we handle different codes for N/A, collapse tail values into larger categories, and ensure that all values are in the correct data type for that column. When the meaning is clear, we also trim the value to make it concise. The resulting dataset is saved as a CSV file for downstream analysis. # Customized cleaning for each column # YEAR df$YEAR &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(df$YEAR)) # CITY # FAMSIZE df$FAMSIZE &lt;- as.character(df$FAMSIZE) df$FAMSIZE[df$FAMSIZE == &quot;1 family member present&quot;] = &quot;1&quot; df$FAMSIZE[df$FAMSIZE == &quot;2 family members present&quot;] = &quot;2&quot; df$FAMSIZE &lt;- as.numeric(df$FAMSIZE) # RELATE df$RELATE &lt;- as.character(df$RELATE) df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Head/Householder&quot;] = &quot;Head&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Child-in-law&quot;] = &quot;Child&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Grandchild&quot;] = &quot;Child&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Parent-in-Law&quot;] = &quot;Parent&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Sibling-in-Law&quot;] = &quot;Sibling&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Other relatives&quot;] = &quot;Relative&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Partner, friend, visitor&quot;] = &quot;Relative&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Other non-relatives&quot;] = &quot;Other&quot; df$RELATE[df$RELATE == &quot;Institutional inmates&quot;] = &quot;Inmate&quot; df$RELATE &lt;- as.factor(df$RELATE) # SEX # AGE df$AGE &lt;- as.character(df$AGE) df$AGE[df$AGE == &quot;Less than 1 year old&quot;] = &quot;0&quot; df$AGE[df$AGE == &quot;90 (90+ in 1980 and 1990)&quot;] = &quot;90&quot; df$AGE[df$AGE %in% c(&quot;100 (100+ in 1960-1970)&quot;, &quot;112 (112+ in the 1980 internal data)&quot;, &quot;115 (115+ in the 1990 internal data)&quot;)] = &quot;100&quot; df$AGE &lt;- as.numeric(df$AGE) # MARST df$MARST &lt;- as.character(df$MARST) df$MARST[df$MARST == &#39;Married, spouse present&#39;] = &#39;Married&#39; df$MARST[df$MARST == &#39;Never married/single&#39;] = &#39;Single&#39; df$MARST[df$MARST %in% c(&#39;Married, spouse absent&#39;,&#39;Separated&#39;,&#39;Divorced&#39;,&#39;Widowed&#39;)] = &#39;Widowed or Divorced&#39; df$MARST &lt;- as.character(df$MARST) df$MARST &lt;- as.factor(df$MARST) # RACE df$RACE &lt;- as.character(df$RACE) df$RACE[df$RACE == &#39;Black/African American/Negro&#39;] = &#39;Black&#39; df$RACE[!(df$RACE %in% c(&#39;White&#39;,&#39;Black&#39;))] = &#39;Other&#39; df$RACE &lt;- as.factor(df$RACE) # BPL # MBPL # FBPL # NATIVITY df$NATIVITY &lt;- as.character(df$NATIVITY) df$NATIVITY[df$NATIVITY %in% c(&quot;Native born, and both parents native born&quot;,&quot;Native born, and father foreign, mother native&quot;,&quot;Native born, and mother foreign, father native&quot;)] = &#39;Native born with native parent&#39; df$NATIVITY[df$NATIVITY == &#39;Native born, and both parents foreign&#39;] = &#39;Native born with foreign parent&#39; df$NATIVITY[df$NATIVITY == &#39;N/A&#39;] = NA df$NATIVITY &lt;- as.factor(df$NATIVITY) # CITIZEN df$CITIZEN &lt;- as.character(df$CITIZEN) df$CITIZEN[df$CITIZEN == &#39;Not a citizen, but has received first papers&#39;] = &#39;Applying citizenship&#39; df$CITIZEN[!(df$CITIZEN %in% c(&#39;Naturalized citizen&#39;,&#39;Not a citizen&#39;, &#39;Applying citizenship&#39;))] = NA df$CITIZEN &lt;- as.factor(df$CITIZEN) # YRIMMIG df$YRIMMIG &lt;- as.character(df$YRIMMIG) df$YRIMMIG = str_replace(df$YRIMMIG, &quot; \\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)&quot;, &quot;&quot;) df$YRIMMIG[df$YRIMMIG %in% c(&#39;N/A&#39;, &#39;Not reported&#39;)] = NA df$YRIMMIG &lt;- as.numeric(df$YRIMMIG) # Creating Years spent in US variable df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate( YRINUSA = YEAR - YRIMMIG ) # SCHOOL df$SCHOOL &lt;- as.character(df$SCHOOL) df$SCHOOL[df$SCHOOL %in% c(&quot;N/A&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot;, &quot;Missing&quot;)] = NA df$SCHOOL &lt;- as.factor(df$SCHOOL) # LIT df$LIT &lt;- as.character(df$LIT) df$LIT[df$LIT %in% c(&quot;Yes, literate (reads and writes)&quot;,&quot;Cannot read, can write&quot;,&quot;Cannot write, can read&quot;)] = &#39;Yes, literate&#39; df$LIT[df$LIT == &#39;No, illiterate (cannot read or write)&#39;] = &#39;No, illiterate&#39; df$LIT[df$LIT %in% c(&quot;N/A&quot;, &quot;Unknown, illegible or blank&quot;)] = NA df$LIT &lt;- as.factor(df$LIT) # LABFORCE df$LABFORCE &lt;- as.character(df$LABFORCE) df$LABFORCE[df$LABFORCE == &#39;N/A&#39;] = NA df$LABFORCE &lt;- as.factor(df$LABFORCE) # OCC1950 # IND1950 # INCWAGE df$INCWAGE &lt;- as.character(df$INCWAGE) df$INCWAGE[df$INCWAGE %in% c(&#39;N/A&#39;,&#39;Missing&#39;)] = NA df$INCWAGE &lt;- as.numeric(df$INCWAGE) # OCCSCORE df$OCCSCORE[df$OCCSCORE == 0] = NA # EDSCOR50 df$EDSCOR50 &lt;- as.character(df$EDSCOR50) df$EDSCOR50[df$EDSCOR50 %in% c(&#39;N/A&#39;)] = NA df$EDSCOR50 &lt;- as.numeric(df$EDSCOR50) # Output data write.csv(df, file = &#39;./data/ipums.csv&#39;, row.names = FALSE) Ellis, Burk, Grover, Minnesota Population Center (2017). ipumsr: Read ‘IPUMS’ Extract Files.

According to its documentation, “missing, illegible and inconsistent values” in variables are edited or allocated, and tagged with data quality flags to indicate the kind of edits applied6. When understanding the missing values in the outcome data, which we will use for this project, we need bear in mind that the above-mentioned sources of missing values are cleaned and interpolated by the IPUMS team to the best they can. To reduce the visual clutter in the plot of missing patterns, we rename variable names into 3 letter abbreviations and remove the variables that are not related to working conditions such as person unique identifier. In total, there are 306 missing patterns, but tails are almost negligible in terms of their percentage. Thus, we focus on top 30 patterns which made up the majority of the data. To do this, we augment the plot_missing function to add a parameter to control how many patterns to display in graph. The results are shown below. # Load data df &lt;- read.csv(file = &#39;./data/ipums.csv&#39;,na.strings=c(&quot;NA&quot;)) # Abbreviate variable names colnames(df) &lt;- c(&quot;YEAR&quot;, &quot;CITY&quot;, &quot;FAMS&quot;, &quot;REL&quot;, &quot;SEX&quot;, &quot;AGE&quot;, &quot;MAR&quot;, &quot;RAC&quot;, &quot;BPL&quot;, &quot;MBP&quot;, &quot;FBP&quot;, &quot;NAT&quot;, &quot;CIT&quot;, &quot;YRI&quot;, &quot;SCH&quot;, &quot;LIT&quot;, &quot;LAB&quot;, &quot;OCC&quot;, &quot;IND&quot;, &quot;INC&quot;, &quot;OCS&quot;, &quot;EDS&quot;, &quot;OCA&quot;, &quot;ICA&quot;, &quot;YUS&quot;) # Remove variable irrelevant to working condition analysis df &lt;- df %&gt;% select (-c(&quot;YEAR&quot;, &quot;CITY&quot;, &quot;FAMS&quot;)) # Plot top 30 missing patterns plot_missing_top(df, percent = TRUE, top_patterns = 30) Focusing the proportion of missing values for different variables, we first observe that basic demographic variables, such as age, sex, race, relationship to head of household, have no missing value for the entirety of the dataset. This is understandable because these demographic information are what the census bureau primarily want to collect, and these questions are asked consistently across the decades. Moving to the left side of the top bar chart, we can see that income, year of immigration, and citizenship status, are the three variables with the highest proportion of missing values. The proportion of missing value of income is due to the fact that this variable is only introduced in the year 1940, the last of the nine census years that our dataset covers. Similarly, influenced by the evolving US immigration law, year of immigration and citizenship status fields came in and out of the census survey questionnaires across the century, resulting in higher percentage of missing values. The next groups of variables with relatively high level of missing values are all occupation-related. In fact, they almost have the identical proportion of missing values. After digging into the documentation and data transformation process, we quickly realize these variables all stem from two root variable OCC (occupation) and IND (industry). OCA and ICA stand for occupation category and industry category, which are higher level categorization of the detailed information. OCS, EDS, PRS are scores that captures the wage level, education level, and prestige level of a certain occupation, thus are tied to the OCC variable7. Overall, 39% of the population doesn’t have OCC information. When inspecting their demographic information, they tend to be younger children or females. This observation is verified by the two graphs below, as females have much higher missing value rate for occupation related variables. # Plot missing patterns by sex df_male &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(SEX == &#39;Male&#39;) df_female &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(SEX == &#39;Female&#39;) # Plot top 30 missing patterns plot_missing_top(df_male, percent = TRUE, top_patterns = 30) plot_missing_top(df_female, percent = TRUE, top_patterns = 30) Finally, let’s switch our attention to the missing patterns. One noticeable trend in the patterns is that the occupation related variables tend to be missing together, a phenomenon discussed and explained in the previous paragraph. The most common missing pattern is the population with no occupation information and no year of immigration, which implies they are native-born residents doing non-wage earning house keeping at home. The next three most common patterns are very similar to the first one, and together they account for about one-third of the population. These missing patterns begs the question of why so many people are missing from the workspace and labor force. Introduction to Data Editing and Allocation. “IPUMS USA.” IPUMS.org.

The following data contains features including three main categories, which are minority features, education features, and employment features. Minority Feature: Respondents Age, Respondents Race Education Feature: LIT(Whether could read and write) Employment Feature: LABFORCE(Whether in the job market), OCCSCORE(Occupational income score), OCC1950CAT(Occupational category in 1950 standard), IND19050CAT(Industry category in 1950 standard) The following analysis will give a glimpse of the minority working conditions, the influence of education levels, and the working conditions transition across different years. 5.1 Working Conditions 5.1.1 Gender and Employment Labor force percentage for each gender: From the following figure, we could conclude that most of the male are in the labor force, while half of the female are not in the labor force. There is significant difference in working conditions between male and female. Occupation score for each gender: The occupation score represents the salary for the workers. As shown in the following figure, the occupation score for male workers are significant higher than the female workers. Occupation category for each gender: There is difference between each gender of the occupation categories. Female tends to work as operatives, clerical and kindred and private household service workers. Male tends to work as craftsmen, managers and laborers. Industry category for each gender: There is difference between male and female in industry categories. Female workers tend to work in manufacturing-nondurable goods, personal services, and professional and related services. Male workers tend to work in durable goods manufacturing, construction, and transportation. 5.1.2 Race and Employment Labor force percentage for each Race: As shown in the following figure, there is little difference between each race labor force percentage. Black people labor force percentage is litter higher than white people. Occupation Score for each Race: Although there is little difference between each race labor force percentage, there is significant difference between occupation score. It shows white people have significantly higher salary than black people and other races. And the variance in salary for white people is lees than other races. Therefore, it means salary for white people is high and centered. Occupation category for each Race: Black people tend to work as operatives, service workers and laborers. White people tend to work as craftsmen, clerical and kindred, managers and sales workers. Industry category for each race: Black people tend to work in personal services industry. 5.2 Education and Employment Labor force for each gender and literate: As shown in the figure, there is little difference between those who are literate and who are illiterate in male workers. Female workers who are literate are more likely in the labor force. Labor force for each race and literate: From the following figure, the people who are literate tend to be in the labor force. Especially for white people, white people who are literate significantly tend to work in the labor force. Occupation score for each race and literate: From the following figure, we conclude that people who are literate tend to have higher salary than those who are not literate. Especially for female workers, literate female workers median salary are significantly highers than illiterate female workers. Occupation score for each race and literate: The figure shows literate people tend to have higher salary. Especially for black people, the median salary for literate black workers are higher than illiterate black workers. Occupation category and literate level: The following figure shows illiterate people tend to work as operatives, craftsmen and laborers, and literate people tend to work as clerical and kindred, sales workers, and professionals. Industry category and literate level: illiterate people tend to work in retail, manufacuring-nondurable goods, and personal services area. And literate people can work in industries like finance, business, public administration, etc. 5.3 Time series and Employment Labor force for races and genders from 1850 to 1940: From the following figure, we could conclude that from 1850 to 1940, more and more female white people enter the labor force. The male workers start to enter the labor force from 1850 to 1920, and then some of them quit the labor force in 1930s and 1940s. Occupation score for races and genders from 1850 to 1940: As shown in the figure, from 1850 to 1940, the female occupation score increases, especially for white people. And the black male workers salary increases a little. The salary for white male is steady across different years. 5.4 Conclusion The minority working conditions are worse than the majority. Female workers labor force percentage is significantly less than the male workers, and the salary for female workers is less than male workers. There is little difference between difference races labor force percentage. However, the salary for the black workers is less than white workers. There are significant difference in industry categories and types of work between male workers and female workers. Female workers tend to work in the industry like personal services as services workers, while male workers tend to work in construction, transportation as craftsman and laborer. For different races, black people tend to work in personal services as services workers, while white people tend to work in officials, finance industries as managers or professionals. Education levels significantly influence the working conditions. Literate people tend to have higher salary and work at officials, business, finance area as professionals or managers. Illiterate people have lower salary, and work at construction, manufacturing as workers and craftsman. From 1850 to 1940, minority people working conditions improve a lot. The salary and percentage of people in the labor force increase for female workers and black workers. 5.5 Animated bar chart In this chapter, we plot an animated graph to show how labor force for each gender has changed over the years (from 1860 to 1940). Since the text cannot be used in transition in D3, we placed a vertical axis on the left of the bar chart with years. An orange ball keeps moving along the axis to indicate which year’s statistics the graph is showing. To make the change in the bar chart more obvious, we alternatively change the filling color of the bars between blue and green every time the year changes. library(tidyverse) library(patchwork) df &lt;- read.csv(file = &#39;./data/ipums.csv&#39;,na.strings=c(&quot;NA&quot;)) drop_columns = c(&#39;BPL&#39;, &#39;MBPL&#39;, &#39;FBPL&#39;, &#39;NATIVITY&#39;, &#39;CITIZEN&#39;, &#39;YRIMMIG&#39;, &#39;YRINUSA&#39;, &#39;INCWAGE&#39;, &#39;MARST&#39;, &#39;OCC1950&#39;, &#39;IND1950&#39;, &#39;CITY&#39;) data &lt;- df %&gt;% select(-one_of(drop_columns)) %&gt;% filter(AGE&gt;=18 &amp; AGE&lt;=66) data%&gt;%group_by(YEAR, SEX)%&gt;%count(LABFORCE)%&gt;%mutate(&#39;bar_height&#39;=n/28000*400) ## # A tibble: 35 × 5 ## # Groups: YEAR, SEX [18] ## YEAR SEX LABFORCE n bar_height ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1850 Female &lt;NA&gt; 1786 25.5 ## 2 1850 Male No, not in the labor force 182 2.6 ## 3 1850 Male Yes, in the labor force 1556 22.2 ## 4 1860 Female No, not in the labor force 2577 36.8 ## 5 1860 Female Yes, in the labor force 752 10.7 ## 6 1860 Male No, not in the labor force 265 3.79 ## 7 1860 Male Yes, in the labor force 2806 40.1 ## 8 1870 Female No, not in the labor force 3036 43.4 ## 9 1870 Female Yes, in the labor force 957 13.7 ## 10 1870 Male No, not in the labor force 230 3.29 ## # … with 25 more rows Conclusions: Most of the male are in the labor force, and the percentage remains relatively unchanged throughout the whole time. Since 1860, the percentage of women in the labor force has been increaasing till the end of the time included (1940). However, by the time of 1940, more than half of the women still remained out of the labor force, yet the difference between women not in labor force and women in labor force has decreased significantly compared to 1860. "],["conclusion-1.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Summary 6.2 Suggestion 6.3 Look Forward", " Chapter 6 Conclusion 6.1 Summary Minority Working Condition: The minority working conditions are worse than the majority. For difference genders, less female workers are in the labor force than male workers, and the salary for female workers is less than male workers. Female workers tend to work in the industry like personal services as services workers, while male workers tend to work in construction, transportation as craftsman and laborer. For different races, the salary for black workers is less than white workers. Black people tend to work in personal services as services workers, while white people tend to work in officials, finance industries as managers or professionals. Influence of Education: Education levels significantly influence the working conditions. Literate people have higher salary than illiterate people, especially for white workers and female workers. Besides, literate people work in more sophisticated areas as “white collars”. Transition across Time: From 1850 to 1940, minority people working conditions improve a lot. 6.2 Suggestion Pay Attention to the Minority: Make policies from the government to pay more attention to minority workers, such as encourage companies to hire more minority workers, set up minimum salary standard for minority workers, etc. Improve the Education Level: Encourage people to participate in education, especially for black people and female people. Schools admit more minority students. 6.3 Look Forward Working Conditions Across Regions: Future study should pay attention to minority working conditions in different regions, since this study only include the samples from New York City. More Influencing Factors: Future study should pay attention to other influencing factors such as family structures, geographical features, etc. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
