# Minority working conditions in New York City from 1850 to 1940

This project is the final project of Columbia University Course GR5702,
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization. The project is about minority 
working conditions in New York City from 1850 to 1940.

## Data Source

Decennial censuses of NYC residents from 1850 to 1940. The source, IPUMS USA, “collects, preserves and harmonizes US census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation.” [dataset introduction page](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/intro.shtml), [sample codebook](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/OCC1950#description_section)

## Content

Theme: Evolving labor landscape of disadvantaged groups in NYC (1850 - 1940)

Descriptive analysis will provide initial insights and raise questions for further visualizations.
What: Visualize and describe the trends in the working life of disadvantaged groups, i.e. females, minority ethnicity, in New York City. Specific aspects include job title, industry, income, employment status, etc. 

Why: 
Education. The change in education received by women/minority ethnicity in the US from 1850 to 1940 and its influence on work conditions of women/minority ethnicity.  
Household structure. More specifically, we may explore how parental income, structure of nuclear family, marital status, among other factors may shed light on the changing workforce representation of the disadvantaged population.
Geospatial. The difference between work conditions of women/minority ethnicity among different neighborhoods in NYC, verifying or disproving the claims of urban slums and spatial segregation. 

Originality: 

While education is a go-to topic for labor related research, influences of household structure and geospatial environment are not studied extensively. Even fewer people make use of the newly-available census microdata and R visualization toolkit to conduct such explorations. These three dimensions we explore here are meant to serve as a jumping board for more creative analysis by anyone interested in further research.
